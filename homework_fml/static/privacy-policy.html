    <h1>Privacy Policy of Homework – Fully Merged List</h1>
    <p>
        As this is a non-profit student project, we <span class="emph">don't have the
        resources to provide any guarantees in terms of privacy or security</span>.
        Therefore, legally speaking, any data you provide to us, or data about you that
        we fetch from other services you provide us that access to, can't be considered
        to be stored privately and securely. Your data acquired in relation to this
        service may be accessed, used or processed in any way by anyone on and off the
        internet. All data is stored in ElephantSQL, therefore their <a
            href="https://www.elephantsql.com/dpa.html" target="_blank">Data Processing
        Agreement</a> applies.
    </p>
    <p>
        All data we store about you is strictly necessary to provide this service and it
        is not possible to make an exemption. <span class="emph">In case you want all
        your data deleted from our storage, please email us at <a
                href="mailto:privacy@homework-f.ml">privacy@homework-f.ml</a>.</span>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
        However, you may read on for information about <span class="emph">what are our
        intentions (which we, as stated above, don't guarantee)</span> regarding
        collecting, processing and storing your data. <span class="emph">The following
        text is not legally binding.</span>
    </p>
    <h2>What data we collect</h2>
    <p>
        All data we collect about you is requested, stored and used only for the purpose
        of providing and improving this service.
    </p>
    <p>
        We need your email address solely for the purpose of identifying your account
        and keeping a way for you to reset your password. We will never send you any
        emails other than to initially verify the email address, reset your password
        when you request it and to inform you about important events regarding your
        account, such as detected password breach or an issue with an integrated
        service.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can enable various integrations with other services. In that case, we need
        to store some information to authenticate to that service to fetch your tasks.
        This varies from service to service, if you are interested in details, we will
        be happy to help at <a
            href="mailto:privacy@homework-f.ml">privacy@homework-f.ml</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        All data imported from the integrated services is stored only for the purpose of
        displaying it back to you.
    </p>
    <h2>Who can access your data</h2>
    <p>
        We don't purposefully sell or automatically provide your data to anyone.
        However, developers of this service may occasionally look into the database at
        various operational data (such as number of registered users). Your data
        (including identifying information such as email address) can be looked at while
        diagnosing any issues with the service. When we authenticate you to the
        integrated services, we only send the data necessary to fetch your homework from
        them. This usually means any login credentials when you add them and access
        tokens from later on.
    </p>
    <p>
        All data is stored in a PostgreSQL database located in Ireland, hosted on
        ElephantSQL (please see their <a href="https://www.elephantsql.com/dpa.html"
                                         target="_blank">DPA</a>). Traffic to this
        application passes through the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/"
                                          target="_blank">Cloudflare</a> network, so
        some data about your usage of this website can be stored there too. <span
            class="emph">Both these services are highly secure, however, I don't want
        to be held liable for any potential access credentials leak etc.</span>

        any potential security and other issues.
